# PSRedgate

This module is designed to create an easy interface for Redgate's command line utilities. This allows you to use Redgate's applications via powershell and creates a seamless way to add the functionality of Redgate applications to your powershell modules.

---

These tools rely on applications from [Redgate.com](http://red-gate.com). All of the cmdlets in this module simply allow you to use their tools from powershell more easily. Their applications still do all the heavy lifting.
